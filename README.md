#### Site Building Description
For my site building, I chose a theme that handled a lot of the backside development of CSS, JavaScript and HTML. As a result, it made my development challenging at times. Personally, this is my first experience working with all of these various languages and applications, so it also added to my challenges. To deal with these challenges, I stayed rather simple and avoided implementing a lot of fancy modifications. Also, I depended heavily on the Midnight theme documentation provided by BluestNight. Working with these solutions, I was able to slowly develop a functioning website that is representative of my personal profile and displays all the relative information. 

#### Audiances
Through this website I hope to target a small audiance. I mainly want this website to be visible to potential employers. This website is not meant to be a populatrity demonstration rather a simple page in which I can be viewed and reached out to by potential employers or other important individuals. 

#### Design influences
The design decisions that I chose to follow helped display the professional evaluation that I have perfromed this semester in a few ways. I wanted to keep simplicity in mind overall. As a result, it allowed me to demonstrate that the professional documents and evaluations do not need to be overly complex. They can be simple and straightforward providing all of the necessary information. This concept was largely highlighted by my website development.
