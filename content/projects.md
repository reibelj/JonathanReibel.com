# Projects of Interest:

* Gator Grouper
 * Developed in the software engineering course, this project was created to develop grouping mechanisms for students based on a variety of parameters. Development was largely team based and required strong collaborating and communication.

* Implementing Security Metrics for Online Office Platforms
 * Currently preforming independent research for my thesis in the area of cyber security and secure data transfer. Developed utilizing Java, Gradle and the APIs of Google Drive and Dropbox, this project has a goal of implementing security metrics in the form of encryption, in order to securely transfer and store data within the cloud environment.

* Optimized Travel Pathfinding
 * Developed with Java during my course work for Algorithm Analysis, This project utilized graphs and path finding algorithms such as Dijkstra's. Combining these, we optimized the pathfinding and applied it to traveling routes. The users can then input their parameters such as time and budgeting in order to find the most effective plans for travel.

* Pikachu Must Go
 * A more whimsical project developed with Python during my discrete structures coursework. The goal of this project was to develop a basic maze game utilizing graphs and dictionaries an allowed the user to guide Pikachu through a series of mazes.
